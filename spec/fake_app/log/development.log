DEPRECATION WARNING: It looks like you are eager loading table(s) (one of: users, books) that are referenced in a string SQL snippet. For example: 

    Post.includes(:comments).where("comments.title = 'foo'")

Currently, Active Record recognizes the table in the string, and knows to JOIN the comments table to the query, rather than loading comments in a separate query. However, doing this without writing a full-blown SQL parser is inherently flawed. Since we don't want to write an SQL parser, we are removing this functionality. From now on, you must explicitly tell Active Record when you are referencing a table from a string:

    Post.includes(:comments).where("comments.title = 'foo'").references(:comments)

If you don't rely on implicit join references you can disable the feature entirely by setting `config.active_record.disable_implicit_join_references = true`. (called from total_count at /home/work/Sites/bootstrap_pager/lib/bootstrap_pager/models/active_record_relation_methods.rb:17)

DEPRECATION WARNING: Using #scope without passing a callable object is deprecated. For example `scope :red, where(color: 'red')` should be changed to `scope :red, -> { where(color: 'red') }`. There are numerous gotchas in the former usage and it makes the implementation more complicated and buggy. (If you prefer, you can just define a class method named `self.red`.). (called from <class:User> at /home/work/Sites/bootstrap_pager/spec/fake_app/active_record/models.rb:13)
DEPRECATION WARNING: You didn't set config.secret_key_base. Read the upgrade documentation to learn more about this new config option. (called from env_config at /home/work/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448/gems/railties-4.0.0/lib/rails/application.rb:141)
DEPRECATION WARNING: It looks like you are eager loading table(s) (one of: users, books) that are referenced in a string SQL snippet. For example: 

    Post.includes(:comments).where("comments.title = 'foo'")

Currently, Active Record recognizes the table in the string, and knows to JOIN the comments table to the query, rather than loading comments in a separate query. However, doing this without writing a full-blown SQL parser is inherently flawed. Since we don't want to write an SQL parser, we are removing this functionality. From now on, you must explicitly tell Active Record when you are referencing a table from a string:

    Post.includes(:comments).where("comments.title = 'foo'").references(:comments)

If you don't rely on implicit join references you can disable the feature entirely by setting `config.active_record.disable_implicit_join_references = true`. (called from total_count at /home/work/Sites/bootstrap_pager/lib/bootstrap_pager/models/active_record_relation_methods.rb:22)
DEPRECATION WARNING: The :distinct option for `Relation#count` is deprecated. Please use `Relation#distinct` instead. (eg. `relation.distinct.count`). (called from total_count at /home/work/Sites/bootstrap_pager/lib/bootstrap_pager/models/active_record_relation_methods.rb:22)
